This is a kit to create a very simple database sufficient for testing SLOB.
For simplicity sake it uses Oracle Managed Files in a directory of your choice. You can set
db_create_file_dest in the create.ora file to any path you choose including an ASM +DG.

WHAT TO CUSTOMIZE
-----------------
Edit create.ora and set the following parameters to a locale of your choosing:

                db_create_file_dest = '/data'
                control_files=('/data/cntrlSLOB.dbf')


WHAT TO DO
----------
$ sqlplus '/ as sysdba' <<EOF
@cr_db
exit;
EOF
