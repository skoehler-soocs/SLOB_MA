The tnsnames.ora in this directory offers an example of 
service names that will allow the user to test RAC with 
repeatable results. Connecting SLOB sessions to the round
robin SCAN listener will result in SLOB sessions connecting
to random RAC nodes. This is acceptable but not optimal and
can result in varying run results due to slight variations
in sessions per RAC node from one test to another.

As of SLOB 2.5.3, runit.sh uses the SQLNET_SERVICE_BASE and 
SQLNET_SERVICE_MAX slob.conf parameters to sequentially 
affinity SLOB threads (Oracle sessions) to numbered service
names. For example:

	SQLNET_SERVICE_BASE=rac
	SQLNET_SERVICE_MAX=8

With these assigned values, runit.sh will connect the first
SLOB thread to rac1 then rac2 and so forth until rac8 after
which the connection rotor loops back to rac1. This manner
of RAC affinity testing requires either a single SLOB
schema (see SLOB Single Schema Model in the documentaion)
or 8 SLOB schemas to align properly with the value assigned
to SQLNET_SERVICE_MAX. The following command will connect
32 SLOB threads (Oracle sessions) to each RAC node in an
8-node RAC configuration given the tnsnames.ora example
file in this directory:

$ sh ./runit.sh -s 8 -t 32
